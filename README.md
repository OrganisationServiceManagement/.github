# Organisation Service Management (OSM)

**Organisation Service Management (OSM)** is a framework, methodology, and set of tools for aligning organisational governance, risk, compliance, IT operations, and business continuity into a cohesive system.  

We build open, modular, and standards-aligned solutions that help organisations achieve:  

- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** Information Security Management  
- **ISO/IEC 27002:2022** Information Security Controls  
- **ISO 22301:2019** Business Continuity Management  
- **ACSC ISM & Essential Eight** uplift  
- Trusted Service Criteria and other regulatory/compliance mandates

## üîπ What is OSM?

OSM is an **automation and configuration suite** that integrates:  

- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)  
- IT operations and service management  
- Vendor and dependency management  
- Strategic objectives, enterprise reporting, and risk management  

It uses a **configuration-as-code** approach to ensure:  

- Repeatability  
- Auditability  
- Alignment to international standards  
- Full tenant ownership and portability (no vendor lock-in)  

---

## üîπ Why OSM?

Organisations today face duplicated, fragmented, and manual processes across compliance, risk, and IT service management. OSM:  

- Automates manual repetition (e.g. ‚Äúfor all X with Y, conduct Z‚Äù)  
- Centralises and reconciles data from cloud, endpoint, and service providers  
- Provides executive visibility through structured reporting  
- Helps organisations evidence compliance and certification efficiently

## üîπ Key Modules

- **GRCosm** ‚Äì Information Security & Risk Management (ISO 27001 aligned)  
- **HRosm** ‚Äì People, Roles, Training, and Competence Management  
- **VLNosm** ‚Äì Vendor and Third-Party Management  
- **CMosm** ‚Äì Configuration and Change Management  
- **OSM Orchestrator** ‚Äì Automation, scheduling, synchronisation, and disaster recovery support  

---

## üîπ Who is OSM for?

- **Small to medium technology businesses** without dedicated security or risk teams  
- **Service providers and registrars** under ISO 27001, ACSC ISM, or auDA compliance requirements  
- **Organisations integrating with** Atlassian, Microsoft 365, AWS, Azure, PagerDuty, Tenable, Intruder.io, and other tooling  

---

## üîπ Our Difference

Unlike traditional GRC/IRM tools (e.g. ServiceNow, Archer, Vanta):  

- OSM **integrates with your existing stack** rather than replacing or adding to it  
- Is **agnostic and customer-controlled** ‚Äì your tenancy, your data  
- Includes an **OSM Guardian consultant model** for deployment, maintenance, and accreditation support
